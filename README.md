Got it! Here's an updated version of the `README.md` with the image placed at the top and React and Vite mentioned as the technologies used:

# Todo List Web App

![Todo List App](./path-to-your-image.jpg)  <!-- Replace with your image path -->

This is a simple Todo List application created as part of my **Web Technologies** subject for the **Micro Project**. The project was built within **2 hours** to showcase the basics of task management using **React** and **Vite**.

## Features
- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides an optimized development experience.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todolist.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todolist
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Key Modifications:
- **Image**: The image is placed at the very top and below the title. Replace `path-to-your-image.jpg` with the correct path.
- **Technologies**: Iâ€™ve updated the technologies section to mention **React** and **Vite**.
- **Installation**: The setup instructions are tailored for a React + Vite project (with `npm install` and `npm run dev`).

This should now match your project setup! Let me know if you need more changes.
